    Truth of the matter is, the game's judge is an emotional creature. Sometimes, they feel bad for the losing side, and decide
    to give them the final prize instead of the winner.
    {{ if player.payoff == 100 }}
        In this case, the judge decided that you won. Congratulations on one hundred thousand dollars!!!
    {{ else }}
        In this case, the judge decided that you lost. Sorry bud, tough luck.
