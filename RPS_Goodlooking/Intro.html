        The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the
        same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or
        scissors.  A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and
        paper beats rock by covering it.  In this simulation, the computer has two
        different strategies that it can follow.

        Rock, paper, scissors is an example of a zero-sum game without perfect
        information.  Whenever one player wins, the other loses.  We can express
        this game using a payoff matrix that explains what one player gains with
        each strategy the players use.  In the payoff matrix below, the rows
        represent player 1's possible strategies while the columns represent
        player 2's possible strategies.  1 represents a win for player 1,
        0 a tie, and -1 a loss for player 1.  So, for instance, the upper left
        entry is a 0 
        because if both players display rocks, they tie.  The upper middle entry 
        is a -1 because if player 1 displays a rock and player 2 displays paper,
        player 2 wins, and therefore, player 1 loses.
